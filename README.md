# nostrability

Nostr will have a shot at winnning because of seamless interoperation between any combination of social media clients, and other stuff.

## what is nostrability
The practical documentation of how various nostr apps play together.

## nostrability objective
Nostrability's objective is to assess the degree of friction of interoperability between nostr's many moving parts. 
To start, nostrability provides a simple crowdsourcing template for documenting poor or lack of interoperability between nostr apps A and B
