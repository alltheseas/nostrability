# nostrability

Nostr will have a shot at winnning because of seamless interoperation between any combination of social media clients, and other stuff.

## what is nostrability
The practical documentation of how various nostr apps play together.

## short term objective
Nostrability's objective is to assess the degree of friction of interoperability between nostr's many moving parts. \
To start, nostrability provides a simple crowdsourcing template for documenting poor or lack of interoperability between nostr apps A and B.

## longer term objective
Systematically document enough friction points to where a dev, or "integration engineer" can collect bounties for fixing friction points, or work full time on cross-app integration (e.g. by way of [Opensats](https://opensats.org)).

## non-objective
Nostrability does not aim to get all apps to implement all NIPs.

## format
To start, I will use the github [issues](https://github.com/alltheseas/nostrability/issues) functionality. It is not clear to me that this is the best format for reporting & discussion. I am open to suggestions.
