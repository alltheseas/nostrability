# nostribology

Nostr will win because of:
1) the other stuff, and
2) a seamless transition between today's notes clients, and the other stuff, and
3) seamless interoperation between any combination of social media clients, and other stuff.

## tribology
Tribology is the study of friction between moving parts.

## nostribology objective
Nostr + tribology = nostribology. Nostribology's objective is to assess the degree of friction of interoperability between nostr's many moving parts. This will be done in multiple parts:
1) Interview nostr developers
2) Interview multi-app nostr users
3) Create scorecard for nostr app interoperability
4) Assess private key tools that provide a bridge between apps (e.g. GetAlby's private key management)
