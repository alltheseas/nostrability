## NIPs

[NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) are nostr implementation possibilities. NIPs are technical and intended for a technical audience in developers. 

The [nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol) allows devs to opt-in to various NIPs. The NIPs carry technical description of various events, kinds, and technical examples that allow devs to implement a particular NIP. 

## Design NIPs

Unlike NIPs, which are technical in nature and focused on an audience of developers, design NIPs aim to add end user centered context, and user empathy. Design NIPs may surface key considerations in user design that are omitted from and do not belong to the NIPs repo. 

## Design NIPs Objective

Given nostr's permissionless protocol, end users are bound to experience a multitude of apps over the nostr network. The design NIPs objective is to reduce instances of negative user experience, and to share design best practices to increase positive user experiences across a multitude of nostr apps.

### Example Design NIPs
